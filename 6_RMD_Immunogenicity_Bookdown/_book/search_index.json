You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). This document will walk through the steps and procedues for assessing the immune response of a therapeutic protein when administered to patients by identifying positive samples through a three‐tiered testing strategy. Three‐tiered Testing Strategy Tiered approach for immunogenicity sample analysis will be outlined. First, the screen assay is used to determine whether samples are positive or negative for the presence of ADA, then followed by a confirmatory analysis utilizing the percent signal inhibition, then further characterization such as ADA titer is reported with positive samples and further drug-neutralizing potential is investigated.

["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Study Information", " Chapter 2 Introduction Therapeutic proteins have the potential to elicit an immune response when administered to patients. An important aspect of developing these medicines is to understand the immunogenicity and to be able to communicate this information to patients, prescribers, and regulators. 2.1 Study Information Client name: XYZ biologics, LLC (Formerly known as ABC Proteins, LLC) XYZ Study No. CA123456 **_ In the experiment, subjects will undergo the following steps (in order): _** ADA Three‐tiered Testing Strategy http://www.e-i-p.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Viswanath-Devanarayan-EIP-symposium-Lisbon-2014-24FEB2014.pdf ADA screening test. If the screening result is NEGATIVE, then the result will be recoreded NEGATIVE, otherwise screening POSITIVE and continue ADA confirmatory test. If the result is NEGATIVE, then the subject will have a confirmatory NEGATIVE result, otherwise a POSITIVE result with a “titer” value recorded and continue Titer. If the result is POSITIVE, with a “titer” value recorded and continue and there will be no more test. The cut-off values to determine whether a subject has POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ADA result are the screening cutpoint and confirmatory cutpoint.

ADA levels for humgensity12345 were estimated to evaluate potential difference between the two products in the incidence of human immune responses. This is a one center, single-blind, randomized, parallel, multiple-dose, safety and immunogenicity study. A total number of one hundred sixty five (164) healthy adult male and female subjects will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 treatments (82 subjects per treatment). Use Mean + 1.645 x SD with caution Only for normally independently distributed data without outliers Usually requires at least a transformation like logs Nonparametric often easier Simply use 95th percentile Caution if unbalanced design Titer Definition Smallest distinct dilution in a titration series with a negative response Response is Sample ECL mean / Diluent Control ECL mean 3.2 Statistical Analysis Anti-drug antibody (ADA): Biologic drug-reactive antibody, including pre-existing host antibodies that are cross-reactive with the administered biologic drug (baseline ADA). http://www.e-i-p.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Devanarayan_EIP_Leiden_2009.pdf Cut points in immunogenicity assays are used to classify future specimens into anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive or negative.

["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods 4.1 Background", " Chapter 4 Methods 4.1 Background ADA Positive Sample: when ADA is detected in a sample, the sample is considered positive. Therapeutic proteins (sometimes also called biologics, biopharmaceuticals, biological products, or biological medicinal products) and peptides have the potential to induce immunogenicity. The consequences of product immunogenicity vary from no evidience of clinical effect to severe, life-threatening responses. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) have been implicated in infusion reactions and anaphylaxis as well as immune complex-mediated disease. ADA have also caused secondary treatment failures (loss of efficacy) and, in rare occasions, more serious thrombocytopenia and pure red cell aplasia. Therefore, ADA are a medical concern in terms of safety and long-term efficacy of the drug and it is critical to evaluate their development in all patients during clinical studies, not just in a symptom-driven manner. With a goal of guiding medical practice, the elucidation of ADA responses and their characteristics relative to clinical consequences is vital (Shankar et al. 2014). ADA comprises neutralizing and non-neutralizing ADA. Other terms that have been used for ADA include anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA), anti-product antibody (APA), or anti-biologic antibody (ABA). Neutralizing ADA (NAb): ADA that inhibits or reduces the pharmacological activity of the biologic drug molecule, as determined by an in vitro test or animal-based bioassay method, regardless of its in vitro clinical relavence (i.e., whether or not test method results relate to clinical impact in the subject). Non-neutralizing ADA (non-neutralizing antibody, non- NAb): ADA that binds to the biologic drug molecule but does not inhibit its pharmacological activity in an in vitro test or animal-based bioassay method, regardless of its in vivo clinical relevance (i.e., whether or not test method results relate to clinical impact in the subject).

If not, please sort the test data by time treat and response as this one. The analysis uses 3 data sets in csv format, that are SIMULATED, assuming lognormal distributions. The values in, and structures of the data as well as any potential conclusions or parameter estimates do not correspond to any real experiment. The purpose of the data sets is merely to illustrate possible (or inadequate) data structures and possible application of the various user interfaces and applications for assessing ADA. "],
